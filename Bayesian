Before introducing Bayesian inference, it is necessary to understand Bayes’ theorem. Bayes’ theorem is really cool.
What makes it useful is that it allows us to use some knowledge or belief that we already have (commonly known as the prior)
to help us calculate the probability of a related event. For example, if we want to find the probability of selling ice cream
on a hot and sunny day, Bayes’ theorem gives us the tools to use prior knowledge about the likelihood of selling ice cream on
any other type of day (rainy, windy, snowy etc.). We’ll talk more about this later so don’t worry if you don’t understand it just yet.

Mathematically Bayes’ theorem is defined as:

P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A)/P(B) 
where A and B are events, P(A|B) is the conditional probability that event A occurs given that event B has already occurred
(P(B|A) has the same meaning but with the roles of A and B reversed) and P(A) and P(B) are the marginal probabilities of event A 
and event B occurring respectively.  

Example
Mathematical definitions can often feel too abstract and scary so let’s try to understand this with an example. One of the examples
that I gave in the introductory blog post was about picking a card from a pack of traditional playing cards. There are 52 cards in
the pack, 26 of them are red and 26 are black. What is the probability of the card being a 4 given that we know the card is red?
To convert this into the math symbols that we see above we can say that event A is the event that the card picked is a 4 and event 
B is the card being red. Hence, P(A|B) in the equation above is P(4|red) in our example, and this is what we want to calculate. 
We previously worked out that this probability is equal to 1/13 (there 26 red cards and 2 of those are 4's) but let’s calculate 
this using Bayes’ theorem.
We need to find the probabilities for the terms on the right hand side. They are:
P(B|A) = P(red|4) = 1/2
P(A) = P(4) = 4/52 = 1/13
P(B) = P(red) = 1/2
When we substitute these numbers into the equation for Bayes’ theorem above we get 1/13, which is the answer that we were expecting.
